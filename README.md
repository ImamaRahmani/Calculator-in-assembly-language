# Calculator-in-assembly-language
The purpose of this project is to develop a calculator as it supports correct calculations. It  is clear that a calculator should relieve the user of the need to do mental operations.  Using a calculator can help save a whole lot of computational time on basic arithmetical  calculations. This makes it easier for them to stress more on important math concepts  rather than stressing more on basic arithmetical calculations. Calculator use can promote the higher-order thinking and reasoning needed for problem  solving in our information- and technology-based society
